# ai_solves_a_puzzle
we are writing an algorithm to give birth to this AI, we will teach it how to solve puzzles using hints. Initially its a baby and just like humans we will try to teach AI to learn information from the given problem, how to make smart choices.
### Requirements : 
1. There's a puzzle board of m rows and n columns
2. There's going to be say a bag of pieces in the form of list given to the AI
3. We are going to give no/some inteligent information to the AI

example :
As an input we are going to give a shuffled list of pieces 

list_pieces = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9 , 6, 7]

size of list_pieces = m * n

This is how it looks after puzzling it together

| 1 | 2 | 3 |

| 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 7 | 8 | 9 |....[3 x 3]


### additional info / heuristic function : 
Like humans we are going to teach the AI how to find information from whatever is the input 
1. is given piece a corner piece
    -> we usually start or identify a piece as corner piece or an edge piece which helps us identify if

### Rules
1. 


The algorithm
1. a baby (brute force see if all work)
2. a slightly smarter baby (remembers if something is wrong)
3. a smart kid (takes hint and learns how to solve puzzle)
4.
